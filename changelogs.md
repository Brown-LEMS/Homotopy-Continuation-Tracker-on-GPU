## :arrow_heading_up: New Updates
1. 2023.05.14 GPU-HC has a new release! <br />
2. 2023.03.12 GPU-HC has now been used in solving generalized three-view relative pose problem. Checkout this [ICCV paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Ding_Minimal_Solutions_to_Generalized_Three-View_Relative_Pose_Problem_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf) and [GitHub page](https://github.com/C-H-Chien/Three_View_Generalized_Camera). <br />
3. 2024.05.29 Major change in the structure of GPU-HC. The GPU code is also optimized, which provides 1.3-6.0x speedup over the older version. This optimized version will become the second release. Refer to the speed in [the table](https://github.com/C-H-Chien/Homotopy-Continuation-Tracker-on-GPU/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#timer_clock-speed-in-milliseconds-for-selected-minimal-problems) which is much faster than what was reported in the papers. <br />
4. 2024.06.14 GPU-HC has a second release! Faster in speed and more friendly to new users who aim to build their own GPU-HC solver. <br />
5. 2024.08.30 GPU-HC is used to recover SLAM tracking failure described by a paper published in BMVC 2024! 
6. 2024.12.19 A detailed analysis of the incremental improvement of the GPU-HC solver is reported in a paper accepted by IPDPS 2025! The code for the BMVC paper and the IPDPS paper are now publicly released. Check [this repository](https://github.com/C-H-Chien/Trifocal_Pose_Estimation_using_Improved_GPUHC) for more information.
